For example, if the payer has the subscriber's name as `Jonathan Doe`, a COB request for `Jon Doe` will fail because the name doesn't match the payer's records. Also note that:\n  - Any prefix on the member's card is considered part of the `memberID` used for the search.\n  - Mismatches in the `memberId` are one of the most common causes of `Member Not Found` errors. We strongly recommend first performing an [Eligibility Check](https://www.stedi.com/docs/api-reference/healthcare/post-healthcare-eligibility) and using the `memberId` in the response to populate your COB check.\n  - We recommend including the `ssn` property in addition to the `memberId` if possible. This allows Stedi to do an additional search for the patient when the `memberId` doesn't return a match.\n  - Stedi can identify coverage overlap for the same payer if the member ID differs between the two coverages.",
